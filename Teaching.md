### Overview
My teaching philosophy is motivated by four main goals: helping students think as social scientists, creating student-driven opportunities that build studentsâ€™ analytical skills, preparing students for success beyond the classroom, and being a welcoming and respectful instructor. 

I work towards these goals by emphasizing the importance of theory and evidence when comprehending, evaluating, and conducting political science research; designing student-led assignments that allow students to scientifically analyze real-life cases and engage in the political science literature; providing students with writing, organizational, reading comprehension, communication, data, and additional skills that they can take with them to future courses, graduate school, and post-undergradute careers; and creating course schedules and reading lists that showcase topics and work from a wide variety of scholars. 

A full statement on my teaching philosophy is available upon request.

### Department Methods Workshops
- __Geospatial Modeling in R__, Truman School of Government and Public Affairs, University of Missouri (Spring 2022)
    - Summary: "In this workshop, we learn about the different classes of data that we can map with using R, including spatial data frames, simple features, and spatial polygons. We also cover where to find mapping data from basic R packages, installed R packages, and shp files. We conclude by learning how to map with ggplot2, how to plot layers of data on maps, and how to customize maps in terms of their coordinates, colors, and other ggplot2 features."
