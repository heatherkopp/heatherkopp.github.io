### Overview
My research focuses on domestic determinants and consequences of interstate conflict and on political competition. I study the mechanisms through which civil conflict leads to interstate conflict, how domestic institutions and political parties affect interstate conflict processes, how foreign policy decisions affect public opinion and voter behavior, and how political parties compete with one another over issues they are perceived to own. To put it more broadly, I have research interests in interstate and intrastate conflict processes, violent nonstate actors, voting behavior, public opinion and foreign policy, and party competition.
